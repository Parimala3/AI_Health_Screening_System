AI-Powered Remote Health Screening System

This project is an AI-based health screening system designed to help patients assess basic health risks remotely and allow doctors to monitor and review cases efficiently. The system uses Machine Learning, Firebase Authentication, and a secure backend to provide real-time health risk predictions.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence and Cloud technologies can improve early health screening and reduce delays in medical consultation.

Project Objectives

To allow patients to submit basic health details remotely

To predict health risk using a Machine Learning model

To securely store health data using cloud services

To provide doctors with a dashboard to view and prioritize patients

To build a scalable and real-world AI healthcare solution

How the System Works

A patient logs into the system using Firebase Authentication

The patient enters health details such as age, blood pressure, sugar level, and heart rate

The backend sends this data to a Machine Learning service

The ML model predicts the health risk level and probability

The result is stored securely in the database

Doctors can log in and view patient reports in a dashboard

Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Input Features:

Age

Systolic Blood Pressure

Sugar Level

Heart Rate

Output:

Risk Probability

Risk Level (Normal / Moderate / High)

The ML model runs as a separate Flask service, making the system modular and scalable.

Security Features

Firebase Authentication for secure login

Role-based access control (Patient / Doctor / Admin)

Sensitive credentials excluded using .gitignore

Secure API communication between backend and ML service

How to Run the Project Locally
1️⃣ Start Machine Learning Service
cd ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

2️⃣ Start Backend Server
cd backend
npm install
node server.js

3️⃣ Open Frontend

Open index.html using Live Server or browser

Login and submit health details

🧪 Sample Output

Health Risk Level (Normal / Moderate / High)

Risk Probability generated by ML model

Color-coded result for easy understanding
